To learn more about the Collaborative Development Model known as "Shared Repository Mode" please read within the following Web page: http://help.github.com/pull-requests/

Simple Daily Git [http://nakedstartup.com/2010/04/simple-daily-git-workflow/]

0) $ git checkout master # Make "master" the active branch

1) $ git pull -r origin master # pull all changes from the remote repository

...then we will each be creating branches by doing this:

2) $ git checkout -b mybranch # Creates a new branch called "mybranch" and makes it the active branch

Do updated work on application

... then

3) $ git add . # add any new files you have created

[Note caution to be used when adding all files (using the period (.)) 
 A preferred method is to use $ git add -i #interactive add for multiple files or $ git add filename # for fewer files.]

4) $ git commit -m "Detailed message here" # make the commit with a nice detailed message

[Note repeat step 4) often.  step 3) is only necessary if a new file has been created.  Use $ git status to inspect untracked files]

[Note $ git commit -am "Detailed message here" # does both steps 3) and 4) in one command]


... pushing changes

5) $ git checkout master # switch back to the master branch when the feature is done. Makes "master" the active branch

6) $ git pull -r origin master # See step 1) for details

[Note Once youre finished working on your branch and are ready to combine it back into the master branch, use merge.]

7) $ git merge mybranch # Merges the commits from "mybranch" into "master"

8) $ git push # sends your changes up to the remote repository

9) $ git branch -d mybranch # deletes the mybranch branch




To Undo in Git http://book.git-scm.com/4_undoing_in_git_-_reset,_checkout_and_revert.html

1) $ git revert mybranch # Revert commit "mybranch"

2) $ git commit -a --amend # To use after you have fixed the broken files.
